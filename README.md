# Fleur de sel ...for hashing salted passwords
This is the experimental code and some results of my recently (Jan. 2024) started research on creating a better salt in order to make hashed salted passwords more resistant to brute force attacks using dictionaries and rainbow tables.

The 'scenario.py' script runs a scenario and saves the results that can be viewed later using the 'view-results.py' script.
